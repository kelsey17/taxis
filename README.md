Welcome to my analysis of NYC Taxi data! I obtained the data from [Chris Whong](http://chriswhong.com/open-data/foil_nyc_taxi/) who was able to access it through a FOIL (Freedom of Information Law) request. The data set contains information on every trip taken in a NYC yellow cab in January 2013 (about 14 million observations). 

My analysis is composed of three files:   
* eda.Rmd (exploratory data analysis)  
* individual_taxis.Rmd (analysis of individual cab drivers, or "cabbies")  
* profit_strategies.Rmd (analysis of cabbie revenue and profit strategies)   

I learned all of these techniques during my summer at [Cricket's Circle](cricketscircle.com)- special thanks to Bryce McDonnell and all who helped me along the way.
